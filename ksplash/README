KDE Splash:
===========

The 'kcm' directory contains the control module for configuring the splashscreen.
Other directories contain various splash implementations:

- 'none' is no splashscreen
- 'simple' is a very simple and fast splashscreen showing a plain progressbar
- 'ksplashx' is a more capable implementation. See its README.

(the KDE3 implementation 'ksplashml' has been removed to /tags/unmaintained)


Theme format:
=============

This is a description of what is shared between the implementations (as needed
by the configuration module and startkde code deciding which implementation to use).
Implementations may have their own additions.

Themes are stored in $KDEDIRS/share/apps/ksplash/Themes/ in a directory specifying
the name of the theme. The directory must contain file 'Theme.rc' describing
the theme and should contain file 'Preview.png' with a preview image. Other contents
are implementation-dependent.


Theme.rc format:
================

The format is the usual ini-style format, e.g.:

[KSplash Theme: Simple]
Name = Simple Splash Screen
Description = Very Simple Optimized Splash Screen
Version = 1.0
Author = Lubos Lunak <l.lunak@kde.org>
Engine = Simple

The group name is [KSplash Theme: <theme name>]. Name, Description, Version and Author
are shown in the configuration module. Engine selects which splash implementation
the theme is for (currently 'None', 'Simple' and 'KSplashX' ). There may be futher
implementation-dependent data in Theme.rc .
