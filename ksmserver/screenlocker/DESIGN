The screenlocker is statically built into ksmserver, it gets instantiated by the main class KSldApp.
It provides 3 main things:
* Shows a fullscreen window (LockWindow class), that spawns into all screens, eats the input events and is black to hide everything.
* Provides the usual org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver interface
* starts the process that will actually show the unlock screen

KSldApp may launch one of two possible unlock screen binaries, decided by the PlasmaEnable bool key in kscreensaverrc:

1) Simple
The one in the greeter subdirectory, built in the kscreenlocker_greet binary.
It uses a series of QML files organized in a Plasma Package to display the actual unlocker ui, one for screen in case of multimonitor.
This greeter can optionally support legacy X screensavers, for doing so creates another fullscreen window per screen on top of the greeter one, and xembends a screensaver window.


2) Plasma based
The source lives in kde-workspace/plasma/screensaver/shell/ and the binary is plasma-overlay.
It instances a Plasma scene and a View and a Containment for each screen in case of multimonitor.
Uses the same QML package to display the unlocker as kscreenlocker_greet.
Does not support X screensavers.
