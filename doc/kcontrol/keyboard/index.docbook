<para>This module allows you to choose how your keyboard works.</para>

<para>There are three tabs in this module.</para>

<sect1 id="hardware">
<title>The <guilabel>Hardware</guilabel> tab</title>
<para>The actual effect of setting these options depends upon the
features provided by your keyboard hardware and the X server on which
&kde; is running.  As an example, you may find that changing the key
click volume has no effect because that feature is not available on your
system. </para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Keyboard model:</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Here you can set your keyboard model. This setting is independent of your
keyboard layout and refers to the &quot;hardware&quot; model, i.e. the way your
keyboard is manufactured. Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually
have two extra keys and are referred to as &quot;104-key&quot; models, which is
probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>NumLock on KDE Startup</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>You can choose to either always <guilabel>Turn on</guilabel> or
<guilabel>Turn off</guilabel> the NumLock when &kde; starts, or you can
choose to have &kde; leave NumLock at whatever it was set to before &kde;
started up.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Enable keyboard repeat</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>When this option is selected, pressing and holding down a key
emits the same character repeatedly until the key is released.  Pressing
and holding the key will have the same effect as pressing it multiple
times in succession.  </para>
<tip><para> Almost all users will want to have this option enabled, because it
makes navigating through documents with the arrow keys significantly
easier. </para></tip>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Delay</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed 
key will start generating keycodes.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Rate</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are 
generated while a key is pressed.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Key click volume</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from
your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. In
essence, this simulates the <quote>click</quote> of a mechanical
type-writer. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by
dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/down arrows on the
spin-button. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key
click.</para>
<para>Many computers won't support this function.</para>
<tip><para>Very few people would choose to enable this option, since it
generally annoys everyone else in the room. However, if your heart
yearns for the pre-soft-key era, this may help you to re-experience the
warm sentimentality of days-gone-by.</para></tip>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="layouts">
<title>The <guilabel>Layouts</guilabel> tab</title>
<para>This tab lets you choose what keyboard layouts you want to use, what
indicator you want in the system tray, how you want to switch and which
shortcuts you will use.</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Layout Indicator</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>You can choose to <guilabel>Show layout indicator</guilabel>
which will show the language iso name in the system tray. You can choose to
<guilabel>Show the indicator</guilabel> even if you have a single layout enabled
and you can show the language flag instead of only the ISO code by checking
<guilabel>Show flag</guilabel>.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Switching Policy</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>If you select <guilabel>Application</guilabel> or
<guilabel>Window</guilabel> switching policy, changing the keyboard layout will
only affect the current application or window. <guilabel>Global</guilabel> will
change the keyboard layout globally and <guilabel>Desktop</guilabel> will change
it only for the current virtual desktop.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Shortcuts for Switching Layout</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para><guilabel>Main SHortcut</guilabel> is a shortcut for switching
layouts which is handled by X.org. <guilabel>3rd level shortcuts</guilabel> is a
shortcut for switching to a third level of the active layout (if it has one)
which is handled by X.org. It allows modifier-only shortcuts.
<guilabel>Alternative shortcut</guilabel> is a shortcut for switching layouts
which is handled by &kde;. It does not support modifier-only shortcuts and also
may not work in some situations (e.g. if popup is active or from screensaver).
