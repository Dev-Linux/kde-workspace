This is a small KDED module that monitors free disk space on the home dir
partition and shows a warning dialog when it runs too low,
with a configurable limit and the possibility to postpone. It was originally
written for openSUSE, but feel free to do grab it (use it, do improvements
like support for KNotification, propose it for inclusion in kdebase
or even proclaim yourself as the maintainer).
