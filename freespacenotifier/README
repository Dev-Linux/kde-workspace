This is a small KDED module that monitors free disk space on the home dir
partition and shows a warning dialog when it runs too low,
with a configurable limit and the possibility to postpone.

It is based on a patch for openSUSE, with many improvements.
Feel free to test it; I am hoping to move it into kdereview soon.
