TODO:
- Fix a bunch of regressions due to plasma core changes (some critical)
- Make handles in corners: resize, rotate, rounded corners, using a nice Phase animation
- Asynchronous image loading (& maybe scaling) currently the plasmoid hangs plasma on image load.
- (DONE) Drag'n'drop for setting the image. Dropping a folder starts slideshow mode. How can we let the user discover it?
- Plasma::Layout? What will happen on different coronas? How should it behave on different formfactors?
- Switch to the standard rotate/resize of plasma when/if avaliable 

- (DONE - default pic installed) Take a default pic from user installed wallpapers to initialize the applet (if internet is not available)
- Make the Wikipedia Picture Of The Day an engine (RSS)

IDEAS FOR THE FRAME APPLET
(some already implemented)

- export the pic to Flickr
- display the album cover if the user is playing some music
- from leinir: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/135/328898823_ae9eb3dfd6_m.jpg 
The images sort of scale down and fade in when the appear... then after thirty or so pictures are shown, the lower ones fade out again :)
- meta data: flip the pic and read metadata (date, size,...) and add your own comment

Settings : organize
