Tooltips
==========

Overview
--------
libplasma provides facilities to manage tooltips that display extended information in a visually pleasing and consistent manner for QGraphicsWidgets. These tooltip windows are themed using Plasma::Theme.

Timeline
--------
Introduced in: libplasma 2.1 (KDE 4.2.0)

Component Type
--------------
ToolTipManager is a QObject subclass in libplasma.

Description
-----------
ToolTipManger is quite simple to use. First you have to register your widget by calling ToolTipManager::self()->registerWidget. After this you have to set the content of the tooltip by calling setWidgetToolTipContent using the struct ToolTipContent.

Widgets are unregistered automatically upon destruction, but can also be manually unregsitered by calling ToolTipMnager::unregisterWidget.

An event filter is registered on each registered widget and hover events that occur trigger calls to showToolTip and hideToolTip. The hover events are not, however, filtered out. 

Note: If another event filter is placed on registered widget that filters out these events, it may be necessary to manually call showToolTip and hideToolTip.
