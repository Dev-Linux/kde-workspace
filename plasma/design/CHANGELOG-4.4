Significant changes in libplasma 3.2.0 / KDE 4.4
==============================================
libplasma
---------
* Features
    * ToolTipManager and ToolTipContent: Tips can now be set as clickable, allowing the mouse to enter them and select an item
    * Corona
        * Supports defining default ContainmentAction sets
    * DataEngine:
        * DataEngine::forceImmediateUpdateOfAllVisualizations() allows an engine to push the current data in sources out to all
          visualizations without waiting for their timeout period. Useful for changes that can not wait, such as time updates
          or data that becomes available with network availability.
        * DataContainer::forceImmediateUpdate() allows engines to do a forced update on just one source.
    * ContainmentActions plugins: allows context menus and mouse interaction to be defined separately from the containment
    * Added Separator class.
    * Wallpapers can now accept drops by defining X-Plasma-DropMimeTypes in their .desktop file and connecting to the
      urlDropped(KUrl) signal
    * Widgets can be published on the network and be accessed remotely. In the case of scripted plasmoids the entire plasmoid package will be sent over, and in any case, dataengines and services will be routed to the remote machine. This is all completely transparent to applets.
    * WindowEffects: a class that permits to control KWin effects in an eas way, hiding the Xatom management
    * Adding new Plasma::Animator based on Qt 4.6 Animation API (a.k.a. kinetic). The following animations are implemented: fade, grow, slide, rotation.
    * Package: contentsHash() provides access to a SHA1 hash of the contents of the package
    * Applet::SetAssociatedApplication(): It's possible to associate an application and/or a list of urls to an applet, a new icon will appear in the applet handle.
      It will open that application or urls.

* Bugfixes
    * Context menu handling on PopupApplets now matches what Applet gets
