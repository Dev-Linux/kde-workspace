Significant changes in libplasma 3.2.0 / KDE 4.4
==============================================
libplasma
---------
* Features
    * ToolTipManager and ToolTipContent: Tips can now be set as clickable, allowing the mouse to enter them and select an item
    * DataEngine:
        * DataEngine::forceImmediateUpdateOfAllVisualizations() allows an engine to push the current data in sources out to all
          visualizations without waiting for their timeout period. Useful for changes that can not wait, such as time updates
          or data that becomes available with network availability.
        * DataContainer::forceImmediateUpdate() allows engines to do a forced update on just one source.
