This is just a rough plan:

* Applications will use the ksysguard library through its API
* Each library instance (one per app) will communicate via dbus to a kded session ksysguard daemon (I like the name "KDE Solid Daemon" perhaps or "KDE System Guard")
* This session daemon connects to a local ksysguardd via K3Process with stdin/stdout, and optionally remotely via ssh
* The session daemon also monitors RAID and so on
