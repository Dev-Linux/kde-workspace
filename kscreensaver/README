KDE Screen Saver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adding (Coding.. Porting..) New Screensavers:

To add your own screen savers you must provide three functions:

void startScreenSaver( Drawable d );

  Start the screen saver in the specified window if it is not currently
  running.

void stopScreenSaver();

  Stop the screen saver if it is currently running.

int  setupScreenSaver();

  Display a dialog so the the user can change the screen saver settings.

All drawing must be done in Xlib.
use blankscrn.*, polygon.* and banner.* as examples.
