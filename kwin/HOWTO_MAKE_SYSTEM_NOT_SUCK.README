If you tried the system window manager style you probably noticed it's not
too nice looking using the standard KDE color scheme. This is because this
is the first style to use a kwin extended color configuration and needs some
additional entries in order to look decent.

Try using the "System" color scheme in kcmdisplay to make it look rather cool.
You'll need to restart kwin because it doesn't handle this dynamically yet.
