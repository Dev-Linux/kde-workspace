This is the beginning of kwin, kwm next generation.

WARNING: this thing is hardly usable now, neither ICCCM nor KDE
compliant yet!

All it has is a context menu that allows you to switch between two
decoration styles, KDE classic and an experimental style.

Please don't work on the code, I'll finish it during my summer
vacations (four weeks from now on).

kwin was only commited to allow people like Mosfet to have a look at
the Client API (and StdClient) to write nifty new themable decorations.

Have fun,
