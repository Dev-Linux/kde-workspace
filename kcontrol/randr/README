Ok, as more people are beginning to discover the joys of RANDR I'd better explain what's
happening.  I have submitted a patch to Trolltech for core support of RANDR, which
mostly deals with not letting popups go off the screen.  I have also written patches
for kwin, kdesktop, kicker etc. to get an (almost) completely well behaved KDE+RANDR.

However, the patch to Qt will appear in 3.2 and I don't think it's a great idea to
have everyone patching their Qts with my version of the patch, unless Trolltech
release the official patch beforehand (I haven't asked, you certainly may.) Still,
if you are desperate for this then please write to me at meddie@yoyo.its.monash.edu.au
and I will send you the requisite patches.

Also, these patches don't deal with the font sizes being off for newly started apps after
a screen change.  Probably a Qt issue, which is why I'm letting them deal with it.

So, to sum it up, you can use these components but without the additional patches
your kicker won't behave, nor will your windows be resized.  restart kicker with
"dcop kicker kicker restart" to get by for now.

I may put these patches in CVS if there are enough requests, or if one day I get time
and inspiration.

For now, I would appreciate comments on the UI to the same email address above.

Cheers,
Hamish.
