Ok, as more people are beginning to discover the joys of RANDR I'd better explain what's
happening. The patches directory contains the patches you need to make this work
nicely with qt and kde.  All of the kde patches have been merged in, exept the
connect() calls are surrounded by #ifdef XRANDR_SUPPORT - remove by hand, and you
need the kwin_iii branch for the kwin patch.

Please note that the qt patch is going to be a part of 3.2 (not 3.1.x) so
if you distribute it as 3.1 make sure it is acknowledged that the resized()
signal is not official api.

Also, these patches don't deal with the font sizes being off for newly started apps after
a screen change.  Probably a Qt issue, which is why I'm letting them deal with it.

So, to sum it up, you can use the randr programs but without the additional patches
your kicker won't behave, nor will your windows be resized.  restart kicker with
"dcop kicker kicker restart" to get by for now.

I would appreciate comments on the UI etc. to meddie@yoyo.its.monash.edu.au

Cheers,
Hamish.
