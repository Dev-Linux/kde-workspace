Remaining known issues

General
	Not tested with Xinerama / multiple screens (but should support them)

Qt
	Font sizes on newly started apps after a resolution change are incorrect (X bug?)
	Popup menus do not get properly constrained to the size of the new window

Kwin
	Move windows if they were partly off before and they are more off now
	Resize maximised windows on other virtual desktops

Kicker
	Perhaps make it more friendly, responding to the screenchangedevent itself rather than requiring a restart via dcop?

KDesktop
	automatically make sure desktop icons are visible
	
RandR programs
	Write a kded module (?) to retain a user-wide setting over logins
	Make KTimerDialog a respectable candidate for kdeui inclusion
