KCM UI
* allow specifying display names
* allow changing variant without re-adding layout
* allow changing layout order
* merge flag and layout map
* hide flag if show flag is false

plasma applet:
* make applet show nicely in taskbar (not just desktop)
* start applet from kxkb kcm

kxkb part
* tooltip (will require loading xkb rules - not sure if overhead is worth it)
* flag

Cleanup:
* rules, iso_codes:
  better error handling

Improvement:
* merge kcm_keyboard.desktop and keyboard.desktop ?
* remove XInput libs from plasma applet and layout widget (find a nicer way)
* optimize fetching groups and layouts (cache them) / fetch current group directly
* show current layouts when "configure layouts" disabled
