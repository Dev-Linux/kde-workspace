Core:
* better handling when layouts set manually and not present in config

KCM UI:
* allow changing variant without re-adding layout
* handle no layouts/1 layout nicer

KCM UI cleanup:
* show nicer flag in the table
* layouts, sizes, alignment etc in kcm

plasma applet:
* make applet show nicely in taskbar (not just desktop)
* start applet from kxkb kcm (currently systray icon provided from kded)

kxkb part
* tooltip (will require loading xkb rules and translations - not sure if overhead is worth it)

Code cleanup:
* rules, iso_codes:
  better error handling

Improvement:
* remove XInput libs from plasma applet and layout widget (find a nicer way)
* optimize fetching groups and layouts (cache them) / fetch current group directly
* refactor/optimize/clean the code

External improvements:
* Change KStatusNotifierItem menu window to be real popup window
* Add KSharedConfig::configChanged() signal
