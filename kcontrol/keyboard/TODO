General
* Why do we have our popup menu triggering window changed event?

KCM UI
* allow changing variant without re-adding layout
* allow changing layout order
* merge flag and layout map in the column
* hide flag if show flag is false

plasma applet:
* make applet show nicely in taskbar (not just desktop)
* start applet from kxkb kcm (currently systray icon provided from kded)

kxkb part
* tooltip (will require loading xkb rules - not sure if overhead is worth it)
* flag (may be text is ok)

systray icon
* transparent background
* text over flag (flag seems better without a text)

UI cleanup:
* layouts, sizes etc in kcm

Code cleanup:
* rules, iso_codes:
  better error handling

Improvement:
* merge kcm_keyboard.desktop and keyboard.desktop ?
* remove XInput libs from plasma applet and layout widget (find a nicer way)
* optimize fetching groups and layouts (cache them) / fetch current group directly
* show current layouts when "configure layouts" disabled
