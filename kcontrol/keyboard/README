This is new project to replace keyboard (kcmmisc) and kxkb 
to manage keyboard harware configuration and layouts.

Components:

kcm_init:
* initializes keyboard hardware (kcmmisc)
* starts keyboard daemon if needed (layouts are configured)

Keyboard daemon:
* configures keyboard layouts on start
* provides DBUS API "org.kde.KXKB/kxkb"
* listens to window/desktop switching if layout switch mode is not global
* listens to new keyboard devices and reinitializes keyboard layouts
* listens to Global KDE Shortcut to switch layouts
* listens to Global Shortcut settings change
* listens to keyboard configuration changed

Keyboard applet:
* displays current layout with text and (optionally flag)
* allows to configure if flag should be displayed

Layout widget:
* displays current layout with text and (optionally flag) embedded in another widget
* dynamically loaded as a plugin
* currently only short text (no flag or long text)

KCM Module:
* allows to configure keyboard hardware, layouts and xkb options (advanced)


Advantages:
* One UI module to configure keyboard layouts and hardware
* Allows to configure keyboard model/xkb options without configuring layouts
* Less cluttered layout configuration control (add layout is separate)
* Layout control/DBus interface is separate from the indicator
* Does not require libxklvier
* Information about current layouts is always taken from X server, so should be more robust
* Cleaner code (rewritten from scratch)
* Due to many points above should start faster (though no benchmarks performed)

New features:
* Allow selection of keyboard layout by language

Regressions:
* can't configure layout short names displayed in applet
* does not start applet automatically when keyboard layouts are configured
* kcm does not allow changing layout variant (need to re-add)
