This is new project to replace keyboard (kcmmisc) and kxkb 
to manage keyboard harware configuration and layouts.

Components:

kcm_init:
* initializes keyboard hardware (kcmmisc)
* starts keyboard daemon if needed (layouts are configured)

Keyboard daemon:
* configures keyboard layouts on start
* provides DBUS API "org.kde.KXKB/kxkb"
* listens to window/desktop switching if layout switch mode is not global
* listens to new keyboard devices and reinitializes keyboard layouts
* listens to Global KDE Shortcut to switch layouts
* listens to Global Shortcut settings change
* listens to keyboard configuration changed

Keyboard applet:
* displays current layout with text and (optionally flag)
* allows to configure if flag should be displayed

Layout widget:
* displays current layout with text and (optionally flag) embedded in another widget
* dynamically loaded as a plugin
* currently only short text (no flag or long text)

KCM Module:
* allows to configure keyboard hardware, layouts and xkb options (advanced)


Regressions:
* can't configure layout short names displayed in applet
* does not start applet automatically when keyboard layouts are configured
* kcm does not allow changing layout variant (need to re-add)
