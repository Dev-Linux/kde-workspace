To build, type...

    ./configure
    make
    make install

---NOTES-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF YOU HAVE USED A PREVIOUS VERSION <=0.10b3 THEN PLEASE *REMOVE* YOUR PREVIOUS ~/.kde/share/config/kfontinstrc
OR ~/.kde2/share/config/kfontinstrc FILE *BEFORE* RUNNING THIS NEW VERSION

PLEASE ALSO APPLY THE CHANGES LISTED IN README.startkde TO YOUR startkde OR login SCRIPT - THIS IS NECCESSARY
IN ORDER TO SET UP SOME ENV VARS SO THAT NON-ROOT USER FONTS MAY BE INSTALLED.

If you have both Qt 1.X and 2.X you may need to set the environment variable
    QTDIR - i.e. for bash, export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt2 
    Likewise for KDE 1.x and 2.X, export KDEDIR=/opt/kde2

The program has the following limitations:

    1. Speedo fonts are always installed as iso8859-1. How do I get an encoding for these?
       Should I just assume iso8859-1, or use the locale?
    2. .Z compressed files are not supported - the program will ignore any .Z files.
    3. Only XFree86 style X config (XF86Config) files, font-server config files, and KFontinst's
       custom file are supported - are there any other types?
    4. AFM files only ever contain 256 chars - should I place all other chars in these?
       And use -1 as charcode? For TrueType fonts this could make these files *very*
       big.

The current version of Qt will not allow you to print out using the extended encoding
schemes (e.g. microsoft-cp1252) - as it has it's own inbuilt charactermaps. The only way
to access other characters is to use Unicode encoding - however Qt creates bad postscript
files when printing with Unicode installed fonts.

*Data.cpp/h files are generated with the 'qtgen' shell script - this replaces some Qt classes with KDE
equivalents. Usage:

    qtgen <file name (-.ui) >

e.g.

    qtgen XftConfigRules

p.s. For using StarOffice with European languages, I recommend using microsoft-cp1252, as this
     allows access to the Euro and "smart quotes" - and KFontinst comes with a modified xprinter.prolog
     file for StarOffice that will be used if the user selects microsoft-cp1252.
